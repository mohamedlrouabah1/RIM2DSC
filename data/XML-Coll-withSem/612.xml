    </b> (or simply the <b>mean</b>) of a list of numbers is the sum of all the members of the list divided by the number of items in the list.  If the list is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../585/27585.xml">
statistical population</link>, then the mean of that population is called a <b>population mean</b>. If the list is a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../361/160361.xml">

The mean is the most commonly-used type of <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../167/60167.xml">
average</link> and is often referred to simply as <it>the</it> average. The term "mean" or "arithmetic mean" is preferred in mathematics and statistics to distinguish it from other <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../167/60167.xml">
average</link>s such as the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../837/18837.xml">

Introduction</st>
        <p>

If we denote a set of data by <it>X</it> = (            <it>x</it>1, <it>x</it>2, ..., <it>xn</it>), then the sample mean is typically denoted with a horizontal bar over the variable (<math>\bar{x} \,</math>, enunciated "<it>x</it> bar").</p>
        <p>

The <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../751/166751.xml">
Greek letter μ</link> is used to denote the arithmetic mean of an entire population.  Or, for a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../685/25685.xml">
random variable</link> that has a defined mean, μ is the <it>probabilistic mean</it> or <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/9653.xml">
expected value</link> of the random number.  If the set <it>X</it> is a collection of random numbers with probabilistic mean of μ, then for any individual sample, <it>xi</it>, from that collection, μ = E{<it>xi</it>} is the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../653/9653.xml">
expected value</link> of that sample.</p>
        <p>

In practice, the difference between μ and <math>\bar{x} \,</math> is that μ is typically unobservable because one observes only a sample rather than the whole population, and if the sample is drawn randomly, then one may treat <math>\bar{x} \,</math>, but not μ, as a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../685/25685.xml">
random variable</link>, attributing a <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../543/23543.xml">
probability distribution</link> to it (the <link xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="../670/520670.xml">
sampling distribution</link> of the mean).</p>
        <p>

Both are computed in the same way:

                <math>\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i  =  \frac{1}{n} (x_1+\cdots+x_n).</math>
            </indent>
