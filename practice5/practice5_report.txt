# Compte rendu du TP5 de RI


## Code updates:

- Improve the CLI interface for the app; 
  launch with -h to see more details.

- Fix weighting functions classes and use them 
  in the ranking process.

- Add a Pytest class for the weighting functions.

- Add a TextPreprocessor class to ease the 
  parameterization of this stage.

- Save the collection with Pickle, excluding unnecessary 
  files like the preprocessor, 
  to avoid the preprocessing stage each 
  time we launch the app.

- Use caching for the computation of each ranking 
  function to speed up the process.

- Add a timer class to measure and store the steps 
  of each process in the app.

- Use parallel computing to reduce preprocessing and 
  indexing time; divide the time by two with an 8-core CPU.

- Fix the display of statistics and ranking results, 
  especially by using the __str__ method on each object 
  that needs to be displayed.
  
- Use PyInstaller to compile Python code into binary, 
  thus speeding up the execution (still experimental).
  
- Create a run class to handle the building of a run result.
